App for gathering friends in events with food.

Satiable-Soiree is a web app that helps to manage events planned with friends. Our mission is to make it so
you can plan events such as picnic's, bbq's, etc. with friends and make the "meal-planning" or prep expectations a piece of cake!

Log-in to the site, and create your event [Name, Location, Date, Time]. Thereafter - add the foods you would prefer to have at the event so your friends can decide what they would like to bring, and they're able to publicly select from the event. Simply share the link with your friends, and Tah-Dah! You have yourself a well-planned party!

Enjoy.
